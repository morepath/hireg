0.2 (unreleased)
================

- If a generic function implementation defines a ``lookup`` argument
  that argument will be the lookup used to call it.

- Added ``reg.mapply()``. This allows you to call things with more
  keyword arguments than it accepts, ignoring those extra keyword
  args.

- A function that returns ``None`` is not assumed to fail, so no fallback
  to the original generic function is triggered anymore.

- An optional ``precalc`` facility is made available on ``Matcher`` to
  avoid some recalculation.

- Implement a specific ``PredicateMatcher`` that matches a value on
  predicate.

0.1 (2013-10-28)
================

- Initial public release.
